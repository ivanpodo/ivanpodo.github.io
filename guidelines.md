# Guidelines

This section contains coding standards and best practices for software development projects.

## Philosophy

These guidelines pursue the following objectives:

- **Comprehensive and readable code** - Code should be self-documenting and easy to understand
- **Consistency** - Establish a common way to approach problems and implement solutions
- **Safety** - Minimize bugs and undefined behavior through defensive programming practices
- **Maintainability** - Code should be easy to modify, extend, and debug

By following these standards, we aim to create a shared understanding among developers, reduce cognitive load when reading code, and prevent common programming errors.
